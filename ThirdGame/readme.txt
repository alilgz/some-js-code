typical HAPPYFARM game 


Project Name: Moon22

we can build base
 different modules 
 need energy  - build battery 
 building cost money, we can earn money by farm minerals



resources
 1. money - buy modules / sell minerals
 2. minerals ( hidden resource? ) 
 3. personnel slots (max number of workers [electricity/food/places] )
 4. O2 generation/recycle (need for people)
      
 5. Electricity [power] need for modules / robots
    static : you can't build if not enough
    +/= : generators give positive value , rest - negative, we just sum it 
     build process  need power? 
    workers need power? 
    robots? ( no need o2, but need power)
 
 6. Time: 
   build module - take time 1-3 days,
   minerals exchanged to money every week? 
   every week one worker can be delivered (added)  ( can be chosen with some random skills?)

 7. research - upgrades for build/supplier rocket/ 

module type   | function  
 main module  | living slots for 5 ppl, generator O2 for 5 ppl,  electricity '5 stars'
 barracs | +10 personnel slots | need 2 electricity [food/water here]
 farm | generate O2 for 7 ppl | need 1 electricity 
 solar power | +10 power 
 defence module - attack? 
 mine - generate minerals  

--
turns
 - beginning of day - Random event ( ???? one [tractor] can be broken/ worker can be sick - disabled for ) 
 - each day some minerals added (depends on skill / number of [tractor])  
 - at end of week all minerals sold and new $$ added 
 - at end of week (if possible) new worker added
 


--
 minerals improver - can be sold more expensive - 
 office  - can choose worker - can pick one who will be 

--
workers skill ( u can't assign them to work, only sum of skills of all make effect)
