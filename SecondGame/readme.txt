


planning new game
story is; you bought new house, there many rooms, but there are weird creatures, ghosts, need remodeling, etc

it can be quest
it can be 'clicker' / aka progress quest
it can be tower defence
or horror game
or shooter

some rooms w/o roof, with damaged walls, floor, tons of shit, mutated rats, cockroaches
some rooms taken by hobos 
one room has  door to town (unlock extra function)



strategy
quest
sim (repair)

make it as sim / td / etc 
room 1 - can be upgraded


game cycle is a day + night 

at day you can: 
 work ( use skills, earn money ) 
 find friends ( they can be guests or live in these rooms?) 
 rent a room 
 learn ( - money, + skills)
 research ( + skills, + area, + new features)

at night:
 defend rooms ( how attack works? )
 research ? 
 sleep 


player resources: 
 few skills  (0-100)
 few abilities/talents (0-1)
 $ money


sub-idea, someone can rent rooms -

sub-idea: bank robbery
 u can make underground way to bank safe rooms 



UI ? 


each room is box
there list of features/upgrades can be bought?



---------------------------

 key features / bonuses
 room 1 : bedroom 
 room 2 : kitchen
 room 3 : gym 
 room 4 : library
 room 5 : garage

---------------------------




simple version:
what should be done to unlock room?
1. open door ( find key? timer? create smth?  ) 
2. all doors can be opened easy, but need to be prepared to clean it 
3. all rooms already opened and can be acessed, but need repair
 3.1 so player can go to market and buy stuff
 3.2 

so, simple sandbox

player (P)
has home (H)
has some money(M)

every day he can choose actions ( each take some time, some actions can start in specific hours )

action can call submenu or just change smth and tell whats changed 
actions take time ( but some take 0)
it can be disabled ( if not meet criteria ) or hidden 





>9:00 Monday [$200, 0 Tired, 0 Hungry, 0 Anger)
> Choose action:  
> Go Work (9h) (+20 Tired, +20$, +1 Specialist[Work], +1 Anger )
> Sleep 1 more Hour(-5 tired, -2 Anger) 
> Go to Library ( +5 Specialist, +5 Tired, -1$)
> Improve Home (sub menu by room)
> Go to Market (Buy supply)
> Walk Around (random things can happen)
> Call Friend (random things can happen)
 
> 18:00 
> Go home -> Submenu 
> Walk Around (random things can happen)
> Call Friend (random things can happen)
> Stay Extra Hour 

What can be upgraded \ changed 
 Job -> from worse to better salary
 repair tool -> just hammer -> repair kit -> workbench
 simple destroyed room -> improved /upgraded specific room 
 
 
how 'Tired' works
 [deadly tired  - very tired  - tired  - normal - rested - energetic]
 can't do anything if very/deadly tired  
 less effective at any action if tired or worse 
 some actions dont need 'tired' (sleep/eat/call)
 if deadly tired for 3 days - game over

how 'Hunger' works 
  [deadly hunger - veru hungry -hungry - normal - Just eated - Satiated]
  if deadly hungry for 3 days - game over

how 'Anger' works
 (on home ) at specific value (10?) you broke random item 
 (at work) you can get fired / no salary today 
        then Anger drops to 0
 can be decreased by specific actions
 depends on Character [?] some actions can add/remove Anger  ()

how 'Prestige' works ??
 more money from work
 better neighbours
 respect from police
 less anger generation

items: 
 money 
 materials
 food
(quest items?)

so basic mechanism: 
 
> Improve Home (sub menu by room)
>> Improve Hall  (prestige)
>> Improve bedroom (Sleep )
>> Improve Kitchen ( cooking )
>> Improve Garage ( car / repair / workbench )
>> Improve Library ( Learn)
>> Improve Backyard  (rest / grow food / etc )
>> Improve Yard  (prestige)

 good hall - good for random guests / police / safety / etc 
 good bedroom - better sleep, less anger generated, 
 good kitchen - better food, more friendly relationship with guests 
 
idea : parralel criminal career (steal/ rob / prison ? / fake identity/etc)
idea: take credit from bank (?)
